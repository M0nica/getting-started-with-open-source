# Hi, I'm Monica 👋🏾

I'm a Senior Software Engineer building educational technology at Newsela. I am passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I created React Robins, which is a community for non-binary and women React developers and recently was selected to become a <a href="https://stars.github.com/profiles/m0nica/">GitHub Star</a> ✨ for my involvement in the tech community.

# What is Open Source Software (OSS)?

Software where the source code is publicly available and is licensed to be redistributed without payment.

<SpeakerNotes>
    
What is open source software? You may be wondering that. You should know the core commonality between different open source software is that it is publically available and licensed to be freely redistributed. The specifics of how an open source project is run varies from project to project.

</SpeakerNotes>

# Different roles in Open Source

- **user** (read access only) - someone who passively consumes software
- **contributor** (_may_ have write access) - someone who has contributed to a piece of software
- **maintainer** (write access) - someone who is responsible for the long-term maintenance of a project and signing off on changes, they may be the original project creator or a user that turned into a contributor and then ultimately a maintainer.

<SpeakerNotes>

As we talk about Open Source, it is helpful to be familiar with the different roles within open source.

A user passively consumes software whereas a contributor is someone who has
contributed to improving a piece of software in any capacity, some
contributors may more-so identify as a user depending on how signficant their
contributions are.

A maintainer has the most responsibility and is responsible
for the long-term maintainence of a project and signing off on any changes. A
project creator can also dissolve themselves of the responsibility of being a
maintainer. For very popular projects it is often necessary to have a maintainer who
can spend the majority of their time on project management and triage.

# Have you contributed to Open Source Software already (in any capacity)?

<SpeakerNotes>
  I am curious how many folks here have contributed to Open Source software
  before?

<SpeakerNotes>
  So you may or may not be aware that there are a lot of different ways to
  contribute to open source from documentation to design to being involved in
  the community or translating documentation or various other things. This slide
  captures some common types of contributions. I gathered this list from All
  Contributors which is a specification some open source projects use in effort
  to more formally recognize non-code contributions.{' '}

# Some potential reasons to contribute to OSS

- it's a core part of your job
- to gain a deeper understanding of technology you use
- to learn technologies you aren't exposed to in your day to day work
- to collaborate with a wider range of developers
- to give back to the community
- build a reputation as someone who contributes to technology
- for fun!

# How Is Open Source Software structured?

<cite>Source: Nadia Eghbal, Working in Public, Page 59 </cite>

<SpeakerNotes>
  I touched on this earlier that different open source projects can be
  drastically different even with technological differences aside. In the book
  working in public, the author Nadia Eghbal categorizes open source projects
  into 4 different types. Often people think of open source projects that have
  high contributor growth and high user growth such as Rust, Node, Linux, etc.
  These are the most complex type of open source projects. Whereas, Clubs have a
  smaller, narrow and focused user base and most people who use the project also
  contribute back to it. Toys might be a side project you spun up over the
  weekened for fun and don't necessarily plan on maintaining or accepting
  contributions for but have made open source. Stadiums are projects with low
  contributor growth and high user growth, there are a lot of populr open source
  libraries that fall into this classification like Babel, Bundler and RSpec.
  Most projects have a signficant portion of commits from a relatively small
  number of contributors.{' '}

> Developers don't contribute to open source for lack of technical ability, but rather due to fear of committing a faux pas...
>
> <cite>Nadia Eghbal, Working in Public, Page 43</cite>

<SpeakerNotes>
  I found this section of working in public, partically relevant to tonight's
  workshops. Nadia claims that "developers don't contribute to open source for
  lack of technical ability, but rather due to fear of committing a faux pas"{' '}
</SpeakerNotes>

> Infrastructure developer Julia Evans, who's well known for her code and words, writes of her experience contributing to open source:

_I sometimes feel kind of intimidated by open source...In open source, I need to send code reviews to total strangers.
At work, I generally send code reviews to the same 10 people or so, most of whom I've worked with for a year or more, and who often already know exactly what I'm working on._

# Open Source Best Practices

- **Avoid submitting unsolicited changes.** Contribute in areas that a maintainer has already given the green light OR open a discussion in a GitHub issue with suggested functionality.
- give as much context as possible when asking for help
- remember that other folks involved in OSS projects are volunteering and/or managing many things so may not be immediately available and don’t have an obligation to respond
- be proactive and read through the documentation as much as possible

<SpeakerNotes>
  {' '}
  You may be curious as to what are common best practices in open source to
  avoid stepping on anyone's toes. I would say the number one thing is to spend
  time to find issues that are well-scoped to your interest and experience
  level. The benefit of this is that if you make an attempt at resolving an
  issue based on requirements the maintainer has already expressed an interest
  in then usually maintainers are more willing to work with you to help get your
  changes accepted into a project.

# Issue - Example Language

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: '85%', textAlign: 'center', display: 'inline' }}
  src="/devto-issue-example.png"
/>

Source: https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/10880

<SpeakerNotes>
  Here is an example issue from the forem repo on github where a contributor
  open up a new issue and answered specific questions to provide context and a
  possible solution for aan issue. There was then an automated bot that
  acknowledged the issue and said it will be taken into consideration. So every
  repo may not have a bot but it is an unwritten rule that if you do not have
  write access to an open source repo than changes you request are suggestions
  that will be taken under consideration. The bot also indicated what labels are
  used to indicate that an issue is available such as "up for grabs" or "ready
  for dev" and that issues should be formally claimed. Usually tha means leaving
  a comment on the issue ticket. The bot also links to a contributors guide,
  which in my opinion is always a nice thing to see from an open source repo as
  it signals that they have documentation specific for contributors and are open
  to onboarding new contributors{' '}

# Example of an a11y issue that I opened:

Source: https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/2883

<SpeakerNotes>So let's look at an issue I opened in Forem</SpeakerNotes>

# Finding Issues

- Use GitHub's issues filter to search for terms like "Hacktoberfest" or "Good First Issue"
- Check out these sites that help people find beginner-level issues:
  - https://goodfirstissue.dev/
  - https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
  - https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners

<SpeakerNotes>
  I came across that bug as a user of dev.to at the time but you can also
  specifically look for issues on GitHub using their issue filter or checking
  out sites like goodfirstissue and firsttimersonly which have issues that are
  recommended for beginners.{' '}
</SpeakerNotes>

# Finding Projects

- Or you can look into contributing to open source software by starting with projects that you are interested in or already contributing to.

- Some of the Open Source Software I relied on for this presentation include:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
    "@mdx-js/loader": "^1.5.8",
    "@next/mdx": "^9.3.4",
    "framer-motion": "^1.10.3",
    "next": "9.3.4",
    "react": "16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "16.13.1",
    "react-swipeable": "^5.5.1",
    "react-syntax-highlighter": "^12.2.1",
    "styled-components": "^5.1.0"
  },
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  So another way you can go about finding ways to contribute to open source is
  by contributing to software you're already using like I was in the case of
  dev.to. For example I used Next and MDX to create this slideshow and this is
  just a snapshot of some of the technology my presentation relied on that is
  open source.

# Is X project accepting new contributors?

Just because a project is Open Source doesn't automatically mean that it's open to new contributors and you can usually get a sense of how supportive a community is of new contributors based on their documentation (or lackthereof)

- when was the latest commit?
- how many open issues are there?
- how many open pull requests are there?
- is there a lot of communication in the repository? Does it appear to be active and timely?
- what type of documentation do you see or not see?
