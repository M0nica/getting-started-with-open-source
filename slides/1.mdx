# What is Open Source Software (OSS)?

Software where the source code is publicly available and is licensed to be freely redistributed.

<SpeakerNotes>
    
What is open source software? There are a lot of ways OSS can be made but the core commonality is that it is publically available and licensed to be freely redistributed.

# Different roles in Open Source

- **user** (read access only) - someone who passively consumes software
- **contributor** (_may_ have write access) - someone who has contributed to a piece of software
- **maintainer** (write access) - someone who is responsible for the long-term maintainance of a project and signing off on changes, they may be the original project creator or a user that turned into a contributor and then ultimately a maintainer.

<SpeakerNotes>
  A user passively consumes software. A contributor is someone who has
  contributed to improving a piece of software in any capacity, some
  contributors may more-so identify as user depending on how signficant their
  contributions are. A maintainer has the most responsibility and is responsible
  for the long-term maintainence of ap roject and signing off on any changes. A
  project creator can also dissolve themselves of the responsibility of being a
  maintainer. For very popular projects it is necessary to have a maintainer who
  can spend the majority of their time on project management and triage.

# How Is Open Source Software structured?

<SpeakerNotes>
  You probably think of projects that have high contributor growth and high user
  growth when you think of open source, very popular projects would fall into
  this scope for example Rust, Node, Linux, etc. These are the most complex type
  of open source projects. Clubs have a smaller, narrow and focused user base
  and most people who use the project also contribute back to it. Toys might be
  a side project you spun up over the weekened for fun and don't necessarily
  plan on maintaining or accepting contributions for but have made open source.
  Stadiums are projects with low contributor growth and high user growth, there
  are a lot of populr open source libraries that fall into this classification
  like Babel, Bundler and RSpec. Most projects have a signficant portin of
  commits from a relatively small number of contributors.{' '}

> Developers don't contribute to open source for lack of technical ability, but rather due to fear of committing a faux pas...

> <cite>Nadia Eghbal, Working in Public, Page 43</cite>

> Infrastructure developer Julia Evans, who's well known for her code and words, writes of her experience contributing to open source:

_I sometimes feel kind of intimidated by open source...In open source, I need to send code reviews to total strangers.
At work, I generally send code reviews to the same 10 people or so, most of whom i've worked with for a year or more, and who often already know exactly what I'm working on._

# Some best practices when contributing to Open Source?

- Avoid submitting unsolicited changes.
- Contribute in areas that a maintainer has already given the green light OR open a discussion in a GitHub issue with suggested functionality.
- Just because a project is Open Source doesn't automatically mean that it's open to new contributors and you can usually get a sense of how supportive a community is of new contributors based on their documentation (or lackthereof)

<SpeakerNotes>
  The benefit of spending the time to find issues that are well-scoped to your
  interest and experience level is that if you make an attempt at resolving an
  issue based on the requirements usually maintainers are more willing to work
  with you to help get your changes accepted into a project.

# Finding Issues

- Use GitHub's issues filter to search for terms like "Hacktoberfest" or "Good First Issue"
- Check out these sites that help people find beginner-level issues:
  - https://goodfirstissue.dev/
  - https://www.firsttimersonly.com/
  - https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners

# Finding Projects

- Or you can look into contributing to open source software by starting with projects that you are interested in or already contributing to.

- Some of the Open Source Software I relied on for this presentation include:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
    "@mdx-js/loader": "^1.5.8",
    "@next/mdx": "^9.3.4",
    "framer-motion": "^1.10.3",
    "next": "9.3.4",
    "react": "16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "16.13.1",
    "react-swipeable": "^5.5.1",
    "react-syntax-highlighter": "^12.2.1",
    "styled-components": "^5.1.0"
  },
```
